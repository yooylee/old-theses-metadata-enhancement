# Theses, 1910-2010 Collection Metadata Enhancement

## The Spark Behind the Project

There has long been a need to determine how many French-language materials are in our institutional repository. Since this information was not previously captured, I saw an opportunity to explore it through one of our largest collections – the [Theses, 1910-2010 Collection] – which also happens to have incomplete metadata.
